# Topic Modeling NSF

This dataset comprises several paper abstracts, one per file, that were furnished by the NSF (National Science Foundation). 

Your task is developing an unsupervised model which classifies abstracts into a topic. Indeed, your goal is to group abstracts based on their semantic similarity.
