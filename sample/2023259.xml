<AbstractNarration>Part 1: Because of the manner in which it is formed at high latitudes in the Antarctic ice, Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is the coldest, saltiest and densest water on the planet. The global circulation of is often quantiﬁed via the transport in a two-dimensional, latitude/depth coordinate space.  However, AABW formation, northward ﬂow and distribution between the Atlantic, Indian and Paciﬁc basins are fundamentally three-dimensional processes. AABW is formed in a handful of distinct sites around the Antarctic coast, notably the southern Weddell Sea, the western Ross Sea, along the  Ad´elie  coast, and  in  Prydz  Bay. AABW is one of the key components of the global ocean overturning circulation, and plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate, on multi-decadal-to-millennial time scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2: Mapping of AABW transport to northern basins is not well constrained, with conflicting conclusions drawn in previous studies. At one extreme  the ACC has been suggested to be a “conduit" that simply allows each variety of AABW to transit directly northward. At the other extreme, it has been suggested that the ACC “blends" all shelf AABW sources together before they reach the northern basins. To close the gap in understanding, this collaborative project draws on three complementary analytical tools: process-oriented modeling of AABW export across the ACC, a high-resolution global ocean model, and an observationally-constrained estimate of the global circulation. The proposed identification and mechanistic understanding of AABW pathways. This project will also advance the careers of three postdoctoral researchers and two early-career faculty members, and will continue collaborative links between the PI and a foreign investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
