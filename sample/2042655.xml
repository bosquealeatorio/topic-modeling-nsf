<AbstractNarration>With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program) and the Division of Graduate Education, this conference project aims to bring together professors, senior university officials, industry experts, and government sponsors, to explore ways to accelerate research in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum information sciences (QIS), and introduce learning activities in AI and QIS early in the education of students at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). AI and QIS will have long term and cross-cutting influence on future technologies, education, the workforce, and our lives. HSIs are colleges and universities with more than 25% Hispanic student enrollment, educating more than two-thirds of America’s Hispanic students. Connecting faculty and senior leadership at HSIs, and minority serving institutions in general, to the networks and resources to support national needs, is expected to increase the number of underrepresented science and engineering students who will contribute to the future STEM workforce. The expected outcomes of this conference will be roadmaps that define pressing research questions and create educational initiatives in AI and QIS for the institutions in attendance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of California, Davis will host the HSI Strategic Innovation Summit for Advanced Research and Instruction in Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Information Sciences (HSI-SIS). HSI-SIS, a virtual, two-day summit, will assemble computing faculty, institutional leaders, sponsoring agencies, and industry, to exchange ideas and foster partnerships to enhance HSI participation in the latest AI and QIS initiatives. HSI-SIS will use a 3-pillar interactive feedback model for convening groups across 3 areas: curriculum, research, and broadening participation. This model will be used to identify ways to develop or expand infrastructures needed to perform research and include AI and QIS into first and second-year college students’ experiences. The long-term goal of this summit is to increase the number of graduates from HSIs who are equipped with hiring-level knowledge of deep learning, big data analytics, quantum computing, and other evolving topics in AI and QIS. Pre- and post- event surveys will be developed and administered, with a report produced by an evaluator to understand the impact of this summit on meeting participants and their institutions. Meeting outcomes will be disseminated at relevant convenings of, for example, the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions, the accrediting board’s ABET Symposium (which includes the Computing Accreditation Commission), Conference for Undergraduate Research, the American Educational Research Association, the Association for the Study of Higher Education, and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims. The project is being supported by funds contributed by the Division of Graduate Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
