<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Arizona to developed a hyperspectral light sheet microscopy technique for live 3D imaging of multiple markers in cells, tissue and embryos. The broad goal of this project is to promote cross-disciplinary education in bioimaging, educate imaging science among students, especially those with biological and biomedical background and underrepresented minorities in the STEM field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific research component of the project aims to advance imaging techniques in the biological and biomedical field for the study of the fundamental Rules of Life. The research will greatly advance the multiplexing ability of live 3D imaging and allow the study of complex biological processes in their native setting. The imaging tool developed in this research will be disseminated through scientific publications, workshops, conferences and open-source sharing of system designs and software. This research will provide a path to study new biological questions that are not possible to study before, which in turn will advance our understanding on development, disease progression etc. and provide guidance for developing treatments and improving human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
