<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor William Shepherd at Sam Houston State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the highest-energy experiment in fundamental physics ever built, and it is producing copious amounts of data and highly precise measurements of the properties of the known elementary particles.  A significant international investment has already been made in its planning and construction, and it is now important that we ensure that we learn as much as we can from the data taken there.  In his research, Professor Shepherd aims to develop tools and techniques to interpret LHC and other fundamental physics measurements within as broad a scope as possible, without needing to refer to one specific model.  As such, these tools will make such measurements easier to interpret in new models which have yet to be invented, thereby preserving and enhancing the utility of this data for the future.  Research in this area advances the national interest by maximizing our understanding of fundamental physical law.  This research also has significant broader impacts, most importantly in the mentoring and involvement of undergraduate students in the process of frontier scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Shepherd will study the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), which encodes in a new perturbation series in inverse new-particle masses all of the possible effects of new physics which are too heavy to probe directly. The SMEFT gives a valuable dictionary for discussing what deviations can be expected from the Standard Model (SM) predictions in such cases, and importantly is valid at all lower energies as well, thereby allowing the complete integration of lower-energy, high-precision measurements such as flavor-changing processes, SM-forbidden processes, and precise measurements of, e.g., parity-violating scattering at low energies.  This work importantly includes theoretical uncertainties inherent in the SMEFT treatment, which enables the bounds derived to be straightforwardly applied to new physics models without the caveats often needed for previous EFT approaches to new physics. This project will build out the number of observables which have been consistently calculated including these errors, design searches which are more sensitive to SMEFT effects and more robust against the theoretical errors, and ultimately contribute significantly to global fits of the full SMEFT parameter space, which have the potential to serve as a successor to the precision Electroweak data encoded into usable pseudo-observables by the LEP ElectroWeak Working Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
