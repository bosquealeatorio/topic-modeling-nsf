<AbstractNarration>Given the underrepresentation of Native students, professionals, and faculty in the field of computer science, AISES believes now is a critical time to focus on strengthening CS research infrastructure of Native-serving institutions to move the needle on this broadening participation challenge. To this end, AISES proposes to build on the outcomes if the first Convening on Computer Science Research Infrastructure for Native-Serving Institutions, by further supporting the development of research ideas and proposals among faculty at Native-serving institutions with the goal of increasing the number of funding opportunities awarded to Native-serving institutions and Native researchers in CS. AISES will recruit participants from the pool of researchers who attended the first convening as well as conduct further, targeted outreach and recruit for new participants from Native-serving institutions, including tribal colleges when possible. The primary objectives of the proposed 2nd convening are to: recruit faculty from Native-serving institutions and Native faculty interested in developing CS research proposals; convene participants to develop project ideas leading to concept papers; and provide technical support for grant writing and communication between participants and collaborators and NSF program officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the proposed convening is to build upon research ideas discussed at the first convening and support the development of research proposals among Native faculty and faculty at Native-serving institutions. The outcomes of the proposed convening will provide examples of best practices for capacity building and developing partnerships aimed a capitalizing on the unique strengths of Native-serving institutions. Furthermore, the convening will provide critical insights into how best to develop collaborative proposals addressing the issues facing faculty and students at different types of Native-serving institutions across the country, including non-tribal American Indian and Alaska Native-serving institutions and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). Additionally, the convening will gather faculty from a diverse set of colleges and universities, providing a unique opportunity to learn from representatives of Native-serving institutions as they develop projects to increase the prevalence of CS research among Native-serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
